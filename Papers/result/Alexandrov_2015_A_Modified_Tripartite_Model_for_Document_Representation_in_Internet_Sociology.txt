Titre du papier  : A Modiﬁed Tripartite Model for Document



Abstract de l’auteur : . Seven years ago Peter Mika (Yahoo! Research) proposed atripartite model of actors, concepts and instances for document repre-sentation in the study of social networks. We propose a modiﬁed model,where instead of document authors we consider textual mentions of per-sons and institutions as actors. This representation proves to be moreappropriate for the solution of a range of Internet Sociology tasks. In thepaper we describe experiments with the modiﬁed model and provide somebackground on the tools that can be used to build it. The model is testedon the experimental corpora of Russian news (educational domain). Theresearch reﬂects the pilot study ﬁndings.
