</auteur><abstract> ROUGE  stands  for  Recall-Oriented  Understudy for Gisting  Evaluation.  It  includes  measures  to  auto-matically  determine  the  quality  of  a  summary  by comparing it to other (ideal) summaries created by humans.  The  measures  count  the  number  of  over-lapping  units such as n-gram, word sequences, and word  pairs between  the  computer-generated  sum-mary to be evaluated and the ideal summaries cre-ated by humans. This paper introduces four different ROUGE measures:  ROUGE-N, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W, and  ROUGE-S  included  in  the  ROUGE  summariza-tion evaluation package and their evaluations. Three of  them  have  been  used  in  the  Document  Under-standing  Conference  (DUC)  2004,  a  large-scale summarization evaluation sponsored by NIST. </abstract><biblio>bibliography not found</biblio></article>
